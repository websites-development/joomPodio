This example shows you how to authenticate using the server flow.
You are stringly encouraged to read about the different authentication methods
at https://developers.podio.com/authentication to determine which is best for
your use.

To run this example:
* Follow the guidelines in the README to setup your configuration
* Specify your REDIRECT_URI (the URL of this file) below
* Run this file in your browser.
